# VK Music Player (discontinued)

A deprecated music player for vk.com

The player doesn't work anymore due to the source site (vk.com) disabling music API.

Main things I've done in this project:
1. Created a WPF interface of an app from scratch,
2. Practiced  
2.1 Reading/writing non-txt files,  
2.2 HTTP requests to API of an external site,  
2.3 Working with external libraries (bass.dll)  

The optimization was done to the point of decent performance on a target platform.
